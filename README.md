# MasterThesis_WhatsWheresHows_of_AI
My first Python project: data analysis of the survey I conducted for my Master Thesis. The survey data focuses on external data use in the context of Machine Learning
I do not claim that this is the best way to analyze the data and I know that a lot of code can be optimized here
but for having taught myself Python over a few months with an online course and using Stack Overflow and Documentations of Libraries while researching for and writing my thesis, 
I think I got pretty far.
I gladly received any feedback for improvements.
Have fun with the data and my code :)
Best wishes
Stuart
